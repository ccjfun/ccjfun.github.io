The S.U.R.F. game from edge://surf

I did not create this game; I just copied the files from Microsoft Edge and modified some URLS so it would work outside of Edge.

## Playing
Play the game at https://surf.jackbuehner.com

## What I changed
- Changed some URLs
- Added a favicon
- Added a manifest.json so the website can be added as a PWA app

## What is not working
- Clicking the treasure chest does not open the popup with the new Edge logo

If you know how to fix anything that is not working, feel free to open a pull request. I'll merge it as soon as I see it and confirm it does not break anything.
